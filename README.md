# FinalProjectDV

The thing that i like the most is that i have learned how to choose the well designed chart to tell the story. Before, i only know Grouped Column and Bar Charts and mostly just use them, but now i have many options to choose, it can be pie, line, area and i like the most is Scatter and Bubble Charts, because it is the best to show the relationship between two series of data, especially when you wanna see the denstity or distribution of your data.

Map and transfer map are also nice, i actually dont have to code much but can use API from google or json to have better and quick result, especially you can easy do settings on an excel file or just have to edit a bit code in html or javascript code.

And here is my final project, when i got collected data, i do some pre-processed data, like use pivot table to summary important factors that i need and i choose chart to visualize the collected data.

Thank you for your time and your course, i really like and enjoy the course, hope i can do further and more with data visualization.
